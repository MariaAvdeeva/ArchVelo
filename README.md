ArchVelo is a method for modeling gene regulation and inferring cell trajectories using single-cell simultaneous chromatin accessibility (scATAC-seq) and transcriptomic (scRNA-seq) profiling. ArchVelo represents chromatin accessibility as a set of archetypes---shared regulatory programs---and models their dynamic influence on transcription. As a result,  ArchVelo improves inference accuracy compared to previous methods and decomposes the velocity field into components, each potentially corresponding to a specific regulatory program.
